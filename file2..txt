adding URL   ( to connecting particular URL to the folder. so we can add that folder in remote repository)
note - we first add the URL then we push our local repo to remote repo using this url connection)

create a empty repository on remote and copy that url  - now add that url. 

below is used to a add a new remote(URL):

git remote add origin "URL OF REMOTE REPO"


below is used to change the url of an existing remote repository:

git remote set-url origin "URL OF REMOTE REPO"

origin is not the remote repository name. It is rather a local alias set as a key in place of the remote repository URL.
origin is the default alias to the URL of your remote repository.


git remote -v 
this will show all the URLs attached to this folder/repo



git checkout file2.txt  
git-checkout - Switch branches or restore working tree files
