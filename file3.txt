UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM -

Generally, upstream is from where you clone the repository, and downstream is any project that integrates your work with other works.

In terms of source control, you're downstream when you copy (clone, checkout, etc) from a repository. Information flowed "downstream" to you.

Using the analogy of a river, we can follow a resource upstream from us until we find the headwaters (the source of a stream or river).

Continuing with the river analogy, downstream is the direction that the water in a river flows. Downhill.

So, if I fork someone's project, The project I forked is upstream. And my fork is downstream.

if someone forks my forked project, Then my fork becomes upstream relative to the fork of my project.

And the fork of my fork becomes downstream.

set upstream in config 

 git config --global push.default upstream
