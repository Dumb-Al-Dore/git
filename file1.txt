you create a folder (normal)
its not yet a gitrepository
you first login to gitbash then 
creat a file in the folder
when you create file its in working directory

check git status 
do git init on folder
when you do git init the normal folder changes to Git repository.

to add the file in working directory to staging area(virtual area)
 use - 
git add file1.txt 
the changes will be saved in .git directory (internal working)

now to finalize it into repository 
use -
git commit -m "file1 added"

Git repository contains code and its metadata.(the whole main folder ) 
.git directory - it contains the matadata of the repository (the hidden folder with .git extension)
