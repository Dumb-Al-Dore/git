you create a folder.
it does not yet have a git repository
you first login to gitbash then 

you initialized that folder.
check git status 

do git init on folder
creates Git repository( .git) inside folder
(The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.)

to start capturing the history of files we now have Git repository created.

its time to create a file - file1.txt
when you create file in folder its in working directory

to add the file in working directory to staging area(virtual area)
 use - 
git add file1.txt 
the changes will be saved in .git directory as metadata(internal working)
(The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.)

now to finalize it into repository 
use -
git commit -m "file1 added"     (-m is message in " " write any msg in it)

the metadata of file1.txt is added to .git repostitory
 

Git repository(.git directory) contains code and its metadata.
 

git status - you keep chekcing if there is any modification in the file1.txt 
if there any it will show
 "changes not staged for commit     modified: file1.txt  "

now to add all changes to .git we use  

git add .               (all commit)S


lets take wedding example - where couples are on the stage and there is a photographer and guest(files) wants to take picture with them
in this anology -  
ambience/hall is working directory.
stage is like staging area 
photographer or album is .git repository

to capture the picture guest(file) have to get up to stage(staging area) and then photographer will click(commit) the picture which will be saved in album(.git)


git log 
to check for number of commits or history
